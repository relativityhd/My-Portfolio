    "text": "At the Age of 15 I began to program in school. I started with a simple Scissors-Paper-Rock game in Python 2 and developed it to an nice usable command line game: 'Scissors-Paper-Rock-Lizzard-Spock' like the game in the TV sitcom Big-Bang-Theory. After my first game I worked together with a friend of mine on simple encryption algorithms and developed new ones. They aren't very secure but it was very fun."
