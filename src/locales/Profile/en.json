I started with a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python 2 and developed it to a nice usable command line game: 'Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizzard-Spock' from the TV sitcom Big-Bang-Theory. I also developed simple new encryption algorithms with a friend of mine. They aren't very secure but I had my fun."

I completed the Computer Science class, where I learned all the fundamentals of IT. Thanks to our teacher Mr. Pelz we also had a project simulation, together with three friends I developed our own Social Media Website. During this time I started using JavaScript and NodeJS. I developed more encryption methods, a password generator, some very simple JS Games and more."
