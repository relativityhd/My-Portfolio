    "text": "This is my very first Software Project. In 10th grade in school we had the task to code a simple scissors paper rock game in Python (2!). I had so much fun coding this, that I continued to add more and more functionality in my freetime e.g. the entities Lizzard and Spock in order to create Rock Paper Scissors Lizzard Spock game from the TV Show Big Bang Theory. It should still work with Python Version 2.6. I think that without this project I wouldn't be where I am today."
